# A hash of yumrepos types.
# 
# These resources will be declared as virtual resources, and will be realized based
# upon their tag values. See modules::profiles::base for an example.
# 
# In some cases, a yumrepo may be definied within it's associated module
# rather than here. This is not good practice, but it's something you
# should be aware of.
#
# Recommend realizing these resources in your profiles.
#
# See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#yumrepo
# for supported properties.
