# A hash of puppet group types
#
# Although these can be defined anywhere in your Hiera structure,
# the most manageable approach is to define all your groups here,
# and realize them in your profiles via tags.
#
# See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#group
# for supported properties.
