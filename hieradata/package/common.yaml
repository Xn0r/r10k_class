# An hash of puppet package types
#
# Although these can be defined anywhere in your Hiera structure,
# the most manageable approach is to define all your pacages here,
# and realize them in your profiles via tags.
#
# This module should only be used for general packages. Do not
# list packages here that might be controled directly using a module
# E.g. httpd should be managed via the apache module, not here.
#
# See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#package
# for supported properties.
